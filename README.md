The most simple GQL app (server + client)

## INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES

Go to `server` dir and run comand `npm install` (it may need root priviledges aka sudo).

## Staring app (server)

Go to `server` dir and run command `node server.js`

## Using client

Go to `client` dir and start `index.html` file . Yes. That's it !

## Using GQL Playground

then click "play" button in the middle of the window
